# users_import_to_wordpress
This is a simple piece of code which I wrote few months back and then I need it recently for another project so did some cleaning and partial improvements ( its still work in progress ) . I will probably do more updates with time depending on the need of it in future but for now it can easily give you a good idea how to make it work according to your need. Its public so you can use it.

This code will help you to migrate your users record from any simple database which contains the record in a single user table.

Since their cannot be any standard table structure involve as every database is different specially in terms of non cms tables so it will not work on your database right away but it will give you an idea how to fetch data from one database and insert it into wordpress system.

Feel free to use it or modify it according to your need.

My next goal is to make something more better to migrate users from joomla to wordpress and viceversa but it will clearly take some time to finish.
